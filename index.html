            <h2>Suggestions for Building Youth Judging Programs</h2>
          </header>
          <br>
          <section>
            <p>Judging programs are an instrumental part of the educational process of youth involved in the horse industry. Youth, parents, and volunteer leaders are interested in judging programs for many reasons. The reasons youth are interested and the reasons that adults are interested in involving their youth may differ in priority. The key to success is being able to develop a program that meets the motivational needs of both groups.</p>

            <p>Most youth enjoy going new places, socializing with friends and peers, having their opinions accepted, and receiving awards. Those with horse interests naturally enjoy learning skills that better their horsemanship ability and technical expertise about horses. As expertise and experience are gained, the desire to compete can increase. While many youth like to compete, contests are but one format for youth to learn. Activities such as field trips to horse farms, and horse shows and games that develop technical skills provide different formats for learning and are popular with youth. These activities should be low-stress, informal, short duration, and non-competitive.</p>
            <p>Successful leaders and coaches personalize their teaching methods, and as such, will have certain techniques they emphasize to teach youth.</p>
            <p>Regardless, all coaches should incorporate the following teaching philosophies:</p>

                  This technique will increase objectivity. When judging halter classes, your most objective comparisons are made when standing at least 20 to 30 feet from the horses. On rail classes, allow the exhibitors to give you the same view when measuring quality of movement, mannerisms, and functional correctness. Many judges will stand near the center of the arena one third of the way off one of the side rails and view the farther side rail when judging group rail classes. When judging individual pattern classes, position yourself in the area that gives you the best view of the entire performance.

                  Distractions that divert your attention away from the class will cause you to miss part of the performance.

          <p>Judging contests provide individuals with the opportunity to judge halter and performance classes consisting of at least four horses in a class. The number and type of classes will vary between contests. The current standard is to provide four to six halter classes and four to eight performance classes. Some guidelines for organizing contests include:</p>

After it has been decided which classes (and breeds) will be included, the contacts must be made to ensure at least four horses for each class will be available. Contest classes should have enough variability to be readily placeable.

                  Individuals are needed to serve as group leaders, timekeeper, announcer, card runner(s), class organizers inside and outside the arena and tabulators. Official judges that are knowledgeable in the breeds to be judged, and have experience as a member or coach of a judging team should be selected as early as possible. Equal consideration should be given to the selection of qualified reasons takers.

          <p>Contests begin by having youth place a series of judging classes. The judging classes are divided into halter and performance. All the performance or all the halter classes may be conducted first. After the classes are judged, youth are given a small amount of time, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, to prepare oral reasons.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Performance classes are judged from the stands. An official calls the gaits and conducts the class via the announcer. Halter classes are judged in groups in the arena. it is customary for more than one class of horses to be shown at halter in the arena at the same time to allow smaller groups for better viewing of halter classes. Contestants are positioned to the side of the horses, approximately 20 to 30 feet from the class, and the horses are repositioned so contestants can see different views.</p>
          <ul class="text-center">
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info"><h4>Suggested Halter Views</h4></li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Side view - 2 minutes</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Front view - 1.5 minutes</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Hind View - 1.5 minutes</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Travel - walk and trot, preferable so youth can observe movement from the front, rear and side</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Side (or ¾ angled) view for close inspection - 1 minute for each ½ of the group</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Side view - 1-2 minutes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Oral reasons are given on several of the classes. The number of oral reasons depends on the contest. Usually at least two to as many as six different classes are identified as ‘reasons classes’. Contestants are informed if a class is being considered for oral reasons before the judging of that class. If there are more potential performance reason classes than the number of reasons that will be given, it is customary for the youth to take notes on all of them before the final selection of reason classes is made.</p>
          <p>Youth are divided into smaller groups to prepare and give oral reasons. Each of the smaller groups will start with a different set of reasons, and then rotate to a new set until all have been given. By doing so, all the reasons can be given during the same time period by rotating the groups around the reason takers. A reasons order rotation system must be developed and remain in effect so all youth are given the same amount of time to prepare each set of oral reasons.</p>

          <p>A four-horse class will have three pairs: a top, middle, and bottom. Officials will place the horses in a class, and then assign “cuts” between pairs. Cuts are assigned to give a weighted penalty for misalignment of horses with the following scale:</p>

            <h3 id="Calculating_Scores">Calculating Scores</h3>
          </header>
          <p>There are several tabulation programs that are designed to calculate scores based on the ‘Hormel System’ of assigning scores based on a possible 50 points per class Some tabulation programs have constraints of four animals in a class and a total of 15 points of cuts in the class. This constraint ensures that there will not be negative scores when a four-horse class is placed completely backward of the official when a possible 50 points is used as the perfect score.</p>
          <p>Scoring can be hand calculated by following the steps in the examples below</p>

                  <br><br>In this example, there is a 3 point cut between the first and second place horse, a two point cut between the second and third place horse, and a four point cut in the bottom pair.
                  <ol>
                    <li>Compare the contestant’s first place horse to each of the other horses in the class. A penalty (cut) will be assessed whenever the contestant’s ranking of the first place horse differs with its official ranking.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Begin with the comparison of the contestant’s first place, 2, and the contestant’s second place, 3. Even though the official placing has these two horses placed differently in the class, the ranking between the two horses are the same in the officials and the contestant’s placing. As such, there are no deductions.</li>
                      <li>Next, compare the contestant’s first place, 2, and the contestant’s third place, 1, with the official. The official places 1 over 2, so there is a deduction. The deduction is 3 points, as this is the total number of cuts between the 1 and 2 in the official ranking.</li>
                      <li>Then compare the contestant’s first place, 2, and the contestant’s last place, 4, with the official. The official places 2 over 4, so there is no deduction of points.</li>
                      <li>So far the total number of deductions is 3 points.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Next, compare the contestant’s second place with those ranked below it (3 over 1 and 3 over 4). The contestant has placed 3 over 1. The official places 1 over 3, and there are a 3 and a 2 point cut separating the two horses in the officials. Total deduction for that placing is 5 points.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Then compare 3 over 4. That ranking is correct according to the official, therefore no point deduction.</li>
                      <li>So far the contestant has accumulated 8 total point deductions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Next, compare the contestant’s third place horse with the horse placing below it (1 over 4). The ranking is correct according to the official, so no points are deducted.</li>
                    <li>Finally, add the penalty points together and subtract from the maximum possible score. In a class of 4 individuals, the maximum score is usually 50. In this example, the contestant incurred a total of 8 penalty points for a total of 42 for the class.</li>

            <h2>Oral Reasons</h2>
          </header>
          <br>
          <p>In the competitive judging environment, major emphasis is placed on learning to evaluate horses. However, successful judging programs place equal importance on students learning to organize and defend their reasons of placing the class. The combined process of placing horses and orally defending those placings teaches students to be objective, honest, and fair in their approach to evaluating the class. Also, this process will discourage student judges from giving opinions that are based merely on personal likes and dislikes, and encourage them to present defensible judgments based on current standards of the horse industry.</p>
          <p>Another major purpose for giving reasons in judging contests is to offer an opportunity for students to learn how to think, organize thoughts, and speak confidently about those thoughts in a refereed environment.</p>
          <p>Giving reasons helps individuals to judge in a more organized fashion. Giving an organized set of reasons will help the inexperienced analyze horses point by point and think in comparative terms.</p>

            <h3 id="Taking_Notes">Taking Notes</h3>
          </header>
          <p>In a judging contest, students are often present their oral reasons several hours after they actually judge the class. Notes enable youth to prepare a more accurate and detailed set of reasons. These notes are only a preparation aid and should not be used during the actual reasons presentation. Brief, understandable notes that are relevant to the class criteria serve as a memory aid. Most judges will use less notes as they become more experienced and more developed in their memory skills.</p>
          <p>Note taking should not interfere with the observation of the class. Notes should be taken after you have studied the class and observed the differences between the individuals. Individual pattern classes require scores and brief notes be taken following each horse. With practice, each person will develop their own method of taking notes. Some use symbols and shorthand methods to save time.</p>
          <p>Notes should contain the class name and the class placing at the top of the note page. Individual descriptions of horses serve as memory aids. Notes should be organized to support the format of oral delivery. As such, notes should be organized so pairs of horses are compared. Several different note-taking grids have been developed to help organization of notes (Figure 1).</p>

          </header>
          <p>There are several acceptable variations of organizational formats for oral reasons. The basis for organization is comparisons of pairs of horses. In a four-horse class there is a top pair (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> place), a middle pair (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> place), and a bottom pair (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> place). Each pair is discussed in terms of comparable advantages of the top placing horse to the bottom placing horse in the pair. From that basis, additional items are added to help assist the clarity, depth, and interest of the presentation.</p>

                  <b>Miniature Opening Statement:</b> Should be a general reason why 1 is placed over 2; again, it needs to specifically fit this pair of horses. Select terminology from the primary selection criteria for that class (Halter: Balance, Quality, Structure, Muscling, and Travel). This should be one sentence by itself.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: “One is not only higher quality, but also nicer balanced.”</li>
                  </ul>
                  <b>Qualify Your Placing of 1 over 2:</b> Use specific, comparative terminology (“-er” on the end of word) to substantiate higher quality and nicer balanced. Qualifying terminology should be given in order of relevancy. If the point did not influence the placing, don’t talk about it.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Grant 2 over 1:</b> Again, in comparative terms, specify where and how 2 is better than 1. In a very close pair, there may be as many grant terms as initial reasons for 1 over 2. In very obvious placing you may have only one or even no grant terms that are applicable.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: “I admit the sorrel with two hind socks is ...” or “finding no major advantages for 2 over 1.”</li>

                    Your reasons should accurately describe the class so that the listener can form a visual image of the horses as you speak. Your goal is to paint a visual image of the class that agrees with what the reasons taker saw. Therefore, always state the most important points first so the official can follow your selection process. If you present the horses in an unorganized fashion or talk about irrelevant points, the reason taker will become confused or disinterested and the result will be a lower score.

                    Higher reason scores are given to those with impact. In other words, those who can say the most with the least amount of words are given credit. Don’t add words and phrases that are redundant or have no impact on the placing of the class. For example, instead of saying “number 2, the bay horse”, say “the bay” or “2”. Reasons must be given within a two-minute time limit and most contests will assess penalty points for going overtime. The average time for a set of reasons should be around 1 minute and 30-40 seconds or even shorter for younger, less experienced judges.

                  Reasons should be organized and systematic. The basic approach is the comparison of animals in three pairs: the top pair, the middle pair, and the bottom pair. The focus should be placed on why one animal is placed over another animal within each pair, and should be given in a comparative fashion.

                  When comparing one horse to another, terminology should always be comparative. Descriptive terminology may be used to a limited extent in the opening statements and to describe faults of an individual. Comparative terminology lists are included in following sections. By using comparative terminology, the student is relating the horse to the horse placed above or below. It will also aid in keeping main points in mind. The top horse in the pair may be well balanced, heavily muscled, and structurally correct, but it is of little concern unless the top horse is more nicely balanced, heavier muscled, and more structurally correct than the bottom horse of the pair.

            <h2>Judging Halter Classes</h2>
          </header>
          <br>
            <section>
              <p>Halter class is defined as a class where the horse is judged based upon its conformation. Conformation is defined as physical appearance resulting from the arrangement of muscle, bone, and other body tissues (Figure 4).</p>
              <p>Rating conformation depends upon objective evaluation of breed and sex characteristics, balance, structural correctness, refinement, and degree of muscling. Balance is the single most important characteristic among all breeds. Balance relates how well the size and shape of the various body parts blend together, and is influenced almost in entirety by skeletal structure. Skeletal structure refers to proper shape and alignment of bones so movement and the potential for performance are increased. Breed characteristics allow for different emphasis of the remaining traits, as some breeds are naturally more muscled than others. Refinement mainly refers to the shape, trimness, and attachment of the head and neck. Muscling refers to both the quantity and appearance of muscle. Conformation is one of the largest influences to performance. As such halter class standards should stress the relationship of conformational attributes that enhance athletic performance.</p>
              <p>Before judging halter, you should be able to identify the anatomical points of conformation.</p>

            <p>Balance refers to how proportionate the parts of the horse’s body are to one another. Balance will aid in quality of movement and maneuverability. A horse can be divided front to back and top to bottom to determine balance. From the profile, balance is seen as the division of the horse’s body into three approximately equal sections:</p>

            <p>The ideal horse is described as a balanced athlete that is uniformly muscled throughout. Muscling aids in the athletic ability of the animal; therefore, horses should have adequate muscling that appears long (muscle development extends to attachment points) and well defined. However, once a horse has adequate muscling, more is not necessarily an advantage. Areas to detect quantity and quality of muscling from the side view include the forearm, shoulder, hindquarters, stifle, and gaskin. From the front view, muscling is observed in the chest, pectoral, shoulder, and forearm. From the rear view, muscling is observed in the lower hip, stifle, and the gaskin. Substance refers to the body capacity of the horse in terms of width and depth of body and height, size, and shape of bone.</p>

            <p>Sex character refers to those conformation traits that define the appearance between the sexes (mares, geldings, and stallions). Type refers to the overall body style and conformation unique to a specific breed. These traits can jointly be referred to as an indication of quality. A nice “profiling” horse is one that combines balance and quality to a high degree. Quality is the overall refinement of the animal. Quality is most easily seen in the head and neck area, but can also be detected in the size and shape of bone and the overall aesthetic value of the individual from the profile. Quality indicators of the head include the length of the face from eye to muzzle; size of eye and ear; and size and shape of muzzle, nose, and jaw. Quality indicators of the neck include size and shape of throatlatch, length and shape of neck, and the neck to shoulder attachment.</p>

            <p>Unsoundness is any deviation in form or function that interferes with the serviceability or usefulness of the horse, and should be considered when placing a horse (Figure 6). Unsoundnesses are most common in feet and legs and occur more frequently in those horses with poor skeletal structure. Correct alignment of bones is essential to maintain the serviceability of the horse. Bone alignment from the forearm to the fetlock, or the hock to the fetlock should be relatively straight in regard to joint alignment when the horse is standing with the feet squarely under the body. Ideally, the knees should be set in the center of the leg with the cannon bone placement directly under the center of the knee. Further, the cannons should be short and strong leading into clean fetlock joints. Also, the pastern should be adequately sloped to receive concussion from movement. Hooves should be well rounded, and roomy with a deep open heel.</p>

            <p>Horse owners refer to various defects as blemishes or unsoundnesses. A blemish is an injury or imperfection that affects the horse’s value but not its serviceability. A small abrasion or unnoticeable wire cut might be considered a blemish. Unsoundnesses are injuries or abnormalities that affect the use or serviceability of a horse. It is hard to distinguish between the two, as a defect may not affect a certain use for a horse. For another use the horse may be unusable. At the time of an injury, a horse may be unsound, but later only has a noticeable blemish that does not affect soundness (Figure 7).</p>

            <p>The way a horse travels is commonly referred to as its way of going. A horse’s legs should move in a straight path. Misalignment of skeletal structure causes the horse’s footfall path to swing inward or outward. This should be considered a structural fault when it interferes with the horse’s normal way of going (Figure 8).</p>

              <section>I placed this class of Aged Geldings 1-2-3-4, starting with a pair of more balanced, heavier muscled geldings in 1 and 2, and ending the class with the lightest muscled, most structurally incorrect in 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although 1 could be thinner in the throatlatch, I placed 1 over 2 as the blaze-faced sorrel is a more structurally correct and higher quality gelding. 1 is straighter through the knees and toes when viewed from the front, and is straighter down the hock when viewed from the side. Additionally, 1 is shorter faced and is wider from eye to eye.</section><br>
              <section>I understand 2 is thinner and cleaner in the throatlatch, and wider through the center of the stifle as compared with 1, however as he toes out when viewed from the front, I left him second. </section><br>
              <section>Moving to my intermediate pair, I placed 2 over 3. The bay is a more balanced, heavier muscled gelding that stands on more substance. 2 has a longer, more sloping shoulder, is shorter across the topline as compared to a longer underline and is more nicely turned over the croup. Furthermore, the bay is a wider chested, deeper hearted gelding that shows a greater circumference to the forearm and gaskin and is also wider through the center of the stifle.</section><br>
              <section>I will concede 3 is straighter through the toes when viewed from the front and tracks truer, but as he is less balanced and lighter muscled, I left him third.</section><br>
              <section>And finally, in the bottom pair, I placed 3 over 4, as the chestnut is higher quality and more structurally correct. Three has a longer thinner neck that ties in higher to a longer, more sloping shoulder, and is more even in height from hips to withers. </section><br>
              <section>Furthermore, 3 has more slope to the pasterns and a more correct angle to the hock when viewed from the side.</section><br>
              <section>I realize 4 is wider and flatter between the eyes, however as the smaller made sorrel is the most structurally incorrect, narrowest made, and lightest muscled gelding of the class, I placed him fourth.</section><br>

              <section>Sir, starting with the individual that best combined quality and muscling and ending with the poorest profiling, I aligned the Two-year-old mares 1-4-2-3.</section><br>
              <section>It was 1 over 4 in my top pair as the sorrel was the highest quality mare in the class. She was shorter from eye to muzzle with a brighter, kinder eye and a more erect ear. To compliment this, she was thinner through the throatlatch and had a cleaner neck that tied in higher at the base.</section><br>
              <section>Now I do realize that 4 was heavier muscled, however as she was long from eye to muzzle and lacked refinement, I left her second.</section><br>
              <section>Nonetheless, I still found her above 2 in my intermediate pair as the bay was more modern in her profile and was heavier muscled. From the profile, she was more expressive in the muscling of her shoulder, which carried down into a larger circumference of forearm. Additionally, she stood on more substance of muscle being wider from shoulder to shoulder and stifle to stifle while having a more bulging inner and outer gaskin.</section><br>
              <section>I realize that 2 was shorter backed. But, as she was short statured and lacked definition of muscle, I left her third.</section><br>
              <section>Even so, it was balance and structural correctness that placed her above 3 in my final pair. The blaze face sorrel not only had a longer, leaner neck but was also deeper hearted and longer hipped. Moreover, she was straighter from knee to toe and hock to heel.</section><br>
              <section>I will admit that 3, the palomino, was more correct in the turn over her croup; however, I left her last as she was the poorest profiling mare being long from eye to muzzle, shallow hearted, and short hipped. Thank you.</section>

          <section>
            <p>The primary selection criteria for the Western Pleasure class are: Manners and Willingness, Functional Correctness, and Quality of Movement. A good pleasure horse has a free-flowing stride of reasonable length in keeping with his conformation. He should cover a reasonable amount of ground with little effort. Ideally, he should have a balanced, flowing motion, while exhibiting correct gaits that are of the proper cadence. The quality of the movement and the consistency of the gaits are major considerations. He should carry his head and neck in a relaxed, natural position, with his poll level with or slightly above the level of the withers. He should not carry his head behind the vertical, giving the appearance of intimidation, or be excessively nosed out, giving a resistant appearance. His head should be level, with the nose slightly in front of the vertical, having a bright expression with his ears alert. He should be responsive yet smooth in transitions. When asked to extend, he should move out with the same flowing motion. Maximum credit should be given to the flowing, balanced, and willing horse that gives the appearance of being fit and a pleasure to ride. The pleasure horse should be shown with a reasonably loose rein, and should execute responsive, smooth transitions when asked. When asked to extend, the horse should move out with the same flowing motion, but with a definite lengthening of stride. The best western pleasure horse combines these attributes into a balanced and willing performer that would be a pleasure to ride.</p>
            <p>Faults to be penalized include wrong leads, excessive speed, breaking gait, excessive slowness, slow transitions, touching the horse or saddle with the free hand, head carriage too high or too low, nosing out, overflexing, opening the mouth, stumbling, short, choppy strides, tight reins, or excessively long reins.</p>

              <section>I placed this class of Western Pleasure 1-2-3-4, starting with the highest quality mover in 1, and ending with the most functionally incorrect in 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although 1 could be quicker in the upward transitions, I placed 1 over 2 in the top pair as the bay was freer and more distinct at the jog both directions, and was more collected at the lope. In addition, 1 was slower cadenced at both the jog and lope, especially when moving to the right.</section></br>
              <section>I realize 2 moved from both the jog and walk into the lope more quickly, but I left him second as he was a less distinct and cadenced mover.</section><br>
              <section>Even so, responsiveness placed 2 over 3 in my intermediate pair. The sorrel was more willing as evidenced by responding more quickly to the rider’s cues. 2 was quicker and more efficient in both the upward and downward transitions and was more attentive with the ears, as well as quieter with the tail throughout the performance. Furthermore, 2 showed more flexion at the poll and backed faster and freer when asked.</section><br>
              <section>I admit 3 was more distinct at the jog, but I left him third, as he was much less responsive and willing. </section><br>
              <section>Nonetheless, 3 placed over 4 in the bottom pair, as the palomino was simply a higher quality and more functionally correct mover. 3 was more cadenced and deliberate at both the jog and lope, showing greater collection both ways on the rail. Moreover, 3 maintained the jog when going to the right, and was more efficient at picking up the correct lead while traveling to the left.</section><br>
              <section>I could find no major advantages for 4 over 3. The chestnut placed last because he was the least broke, evidenced by breaking gait at the trot, missing the left lead and consistently requiring excessive amounts of cueing. Thank you.</section>

          <section>
            <p>The primary selection criteria used to evaluate the Hunter Under Saddle class are: Manners and Willingness, Quality of Movement, and Functional Correctness. Hunters Under Saddle should be suitable to purpose. Hunters should move with long, low strides reaching forward with ease and smoothness, be able to lengthen stride and cover ground with relaxed, free-flowing movement, while exhibiting correct gaits that are of the proper cadence. The quality of movement and the consistency of the gaits are major considerations. Horses should be obedient, have a bright expression with alert ears, and should respond willingly to the rider with light leg and hand contact. Horses should be responsive and smooth in transition. When asked to extend the trot, or hand gallop, they should move out with the same flowing motion. The poll should be level with, or slightly above, the withers to allow proper impulsion behind. The head position should be slightly in front of or on the vertical.</p>
            <p>Entries shall be penalized for being on wrong lead, or wrong diagonal at the trot; quick, short, or vertical stride; excessive speed; excessive slowness; failure to take the appropriate gait when called for; head carriage too high or low; over flexing or excessive nosing out; stumbling, failure to maintain light contact on the horse’s mouth; breaking gait; tossing of head; consistently showing too far off the rail.</p>

              <section>Sir,  I  placed  the  Hunter  Under  Saddle  1-2-3-4, starting  with  two  more  suitable  to  purpose  horses in  1  and  2,  and  ending  with  the  ill  mannered,  less suitable in 4.</section><br>
              <section>I  realize  that  1  could  be  somewhat  smoother  in downward transitions; however it is his advantage in  responsiveness  and  movement  that  places  him over 2. The chestnut is more mannerly, being quieter and more mindful of the bit, while also being quieter with  the  tail.  Furthermore,  1  moves  with  a  more consistently  cadenced,  forward  moving  trot  when moving to the left.</section></br>
              <section>I admit 2 more willingly moves into the trot from the  canter;  however,  as  he  is  less  consistent  at  the trot, and mouths the bit, I left him second.</section><br>
              <section>Moving to the intermediate pair, I placed 2 over 3,  as  the  brown  is  better  suited  to  purpose.  2  is  a bolder  moving  horse,  showing  greater  extension of stride and moving in a flatter, lower frame at both  the  trot  and  canter.  In  addition,  2  responds more  quickly  to  the  rider  in  both  the  upward  and downward transitions.</section><br>
              <section>Admittedly, 3 is more accepting of the bit. But I left him third as he is short strided and elevated in his frame.</section><br>
              <section>Even so, it is 3’s advantage in manners that places him over 4 in the bottom pair. 3 is quieter with the bit and requires less obvious aids and cues from the rider. Additionally he performs with a more pleasant expression  while  being  ridden  on  a  more  desirable amount of contact.</section><br>
              <section>I grant that 4 is more forward moving and freer at  the  walk.  Nonetheless,  this  bay  places  last  as  he travels  with  excessive  speed  at  the  canter.  Further, 4  requires  excessive  handling  from  the  rider,  thus making  him  the  least  suitable  hunter  in  the  class.</section><br>
              <section>Thank you.</section>

          <section>
            <p>The primary selection criteria used to judge the Hunter Hack class are: Manners and Willingness, Way of Going, and Jumping Style. The hunter hack horse should move in the same style as a working hunter. The class will be judged on style over fences, even hunting pace, flat work, manners, and way of going. Horses shall be credited with maintaining an even hunting pace that covers the course with free-flowing strides. Preference is given to horses with correct jumping style that meets fences square, jumping at the center of the fence. Unsafe jumping and bad form over fences, including twisting, shall be penalized whether the fence was touched or untouched. Incorrect leads around the ends of the course and cross cantering shall be penalized, as well as excessive use of a crop. Fences in a line should be taken in the correct number of strides or be penalized. Any error that endangers the horse and/or its rider, particularly refusals or knockdowns, shall be heavily penalized. Faults to be scored accordingly during the rail work include being on wrong lead, excessive speed or slowness at any gait, break of gait, failure to take gait, head carriage too low or high, nosing out or flexing behind the vertical, opening mouth excessively, or stumbling.</p>

              <section>I placed the Hunter Hack 1-2-3-4, starting with the horse that best combined the fence and rail work to the highest degree and ending with the least broke hunter in 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although, 1 could have jumped more near the center of each fence, I nonetheless preferred the gray as 1 showed more interest in the fences and met them more correctly in stride. Furthermore, 1 pushed off his hocks more effectively providing more drive over the fences while being more even and horizontal in his forearms and tightly tucked in the lower leg. 1 showed less resistance to the rider down the line and on the rail by being quieter with his mouth and tail.</section><br>
              <section>I realize the bay was longer strided at the trot, however as 2 was looser in the knee position over the fences, and was less responsive to the rider requiring more handling, I left the him second.</section><br>
              <section>Still, I preferred the movement and fence work of the dark bay to 3 in my intermediate pair. 2 moved out with a longer, more reaching stride having more freedom in the shoulder and stifle. The bay worked with more impulsion from the hindquarters and thus, was more distinct at the canter. As well, 2 took a more appropriate number of strides between the fences.</section><br>
              <section>I grant 3 approached the first fence more nearly in the center of the rail, and was tighter in the knees on the first fence. However, as the black was shorter strided, taking an extra stride between the fences and ticked the second fence, I placed 3 third.</section><br>
              <section>Even so, in my bottom pair manners, willingness and correctness place 3 over 4. The black was more responsive to the rider, more willing and freer from refusals. Additionally, 3 remained straighter when approaching the first fence, maintained the canter between the fences, and changed to the correct lead after the second fence. On the flat, 3 required less handling and traveled with a more level head set.</section><br>
              <section>I agree 4 was flatter, more forward moving at the canter. However, as the chestnut was the least broke, most dangerous jumper who broke gait between fences, had a run out on the second fence, and was handled excessively on the rail, I placed 4 last.</section>

          <section>
            <p>The primary selection criteria for the Western Riding class are: Quality of Lead Changes, Movement, and Mannerisms. Western Riding is the performance of a sensible, well-mannered, and free and easy moving horse. Horses individually complete a prescribed pattern that is designed to score the ability of the horse to change leads. Scoring systems are detailed in rulebooks. Incomplete or incorrect lead changes are penalized. Individual maneuvers within the pattern are scored positively or negatively. The horse will be judged on quality of gaits, change of leads, response to the rider, manners, disposition, and intelligence. The horse should perform with reasonable speed and be sensible, well-mannered, and free and easy moving. Credit shall be given for and emphasis placed on smoothness; even cadence of gaits; and the horse’s ability to change leads precisely, easily, and simultaneously both rear and front at the center point between markers. The horse should have a relaxed head carriage showing response to the rider’s hands, with a moderate flexation at the poll. Horses may be ridden with light contact or on a reasonably loose rein. The horse should negotiate the pattern in an easy fashion, neither diving into nor rushing through the markers. The horse should cross the log both at the jog and the lope without breaking gait or radically changing stride.</p>

              <section>Sir, I placed the Western Riding 1-2-3-4, starting with the smoothest and most precise lead changer in 1, and ending with the most functionally incorrect in 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although, 1 could be flatter in the first line side change, still in the top pair I placed 1 over 2 as the sorrel is more responsive and smoother throughout the pattern. 1 changes more nearly in the center of the cones down the line. Furthermore, 1 is more evenly cadenced from start to finish and backs more readily when asked.</section><br>
              <section>I realize 2 is quicker and quieter in the transition to the lope, but received too many penalties for changing early down the line to be placed higher.</section><br>
              <section>Moving to the intermediate pair, I placed 2 over 3, as the bay is a higher quality mover and is smoother and flatter in the lead changes. 2 was more forward moving at the jog and lope, and changed more simultaneously and in cadence than 3.</section><br>
              <section>I admit 3 changed more precisely on the first and fourth line changes; however, 3 lacked the quality of movement and lead change of 2.</section><br>
              <section>Finally in the bottom pair, I placed 3 over 4, as the chestnut is more functionally correct, having completed all the changes prescribed in the pattern. In addition, 3 cleanly crosses the log at the lope.</section><br>
              <section>I have no obvious advantages of 4 over 3. The blaze-faced sorrel is the most penalized horse, having failed to change behind when moving left to right on the cross changes, and rolling the log when crossing at the lope. 4 also received a penalty for completing an extra lead change between the log and the stop.</section><br>
              <section>Thank you.</section>

          <section>
            <p>The primary selection criteria for judging the reining class are: Mannerisms and Discipline, Pattern Accuracy, and Degree of Challenge. Horses individually complete a prescribed pattern that is designed to score the ability of the horse to rein. Scoring systems are detailed in rulebooks. Quality of performing the individual maneuvers within the pattern is scored positively or negatively. Additionally, incomplete or incorrect maneuvers are penalized.</p>
            <p>To rein a horse is not only to guide him but also to control his every movement. The best-reined horse should be willingly guided or controlled with little or no apparent resistance and dictated to completely. Any movement on his own must be considered a lack of control. All deviations from the exact written pattern must be considered a lack of/or temporary loss of control and therefore a fault that must be marked down according to severity of deviation. After deducting all faults against execution of the pattern and the horse’s overall performance, credit should be given for smoothness, finesse, attitude, quickness, and authority of performing various maneuvers, while using controlled speed which raises the difficulty level and makes him more exciting and pleasing for an audience to watch.</p>

              <section>I placed the Reining 1-2-3-4, starting with 1 who best combines control and challenge of pattern and ending with the most resistant, most penalized, least controlled in 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although, 1 could be more precise in finishing the spins to the right, 1 still places over 2 in the top pair. The bay runs more symmetrical, faster large circles, and is more willing to slow to the small circles. 1 is also more precise in the lead change of the figure 8, changing more simultaneously.</section><br>
              <section>I admit 2 is more correct in finishing the spins to the right; but places second as he shows less speed variation in his circles and run-downs to the roll-backs and stop. 2 further incurs a 1 point penalty for delaying the lead change of the figure 8.</section><br>
              <section>Even so, 2 places above 3 in the middle pair, as the sorrel is much more responsive and willing to the rider. 2 is more symmetrical in the circles, and was more willfully guided to both rollbacks and the stop. 2 completes the spins more precisely. Even though 3 more efficiently changes leads in the figure 8, the small bay places third for mouthing the bit excessively and for being resistant and hesitant in the roll backs.</section><br>
              <section>Still yet, pattern precision placed 3 over 4 in the bottom pair. 3 receives less maneuver penalties, is more willingly guided and completes the pattern with a more pleasant attitude.</section><br>
              <section>Finding no obvious grant of 4 over 3 and as 4 receives a 5-point penalty for kicking out while requiring excessive handling from the rider, I left him last. Thank You.</section>

              <section>Sir, starting with a pair of individuals that best combined finesse, speed, and agility, I aligned the reining 3-4-2-1.</section><br>
              <section>In my initial pair of bays, it was 3 over 4 as 3 simply ran the more demanding and aggressive pattern. He carried this advantage into his rundowns which allowed him to develop more speed and drop down harder into the ground causing him to have longer sliding stops. </section><br>
              <section>I do realize that 4 did back faster and settled more readily; unfortunately he was short and restricted in his stops, so I left him second.</section><br>
              <section>Despite this, it was 4’s degree of difficulty and pattern precision that separated him from 2 in my intermediate pair. The bay maintained a lower center of gravity during the spins, and maintained a more stationary hind pivot foot while crossing over more efficiently up front. Along with this, he was faster spinning and also more correct in the stopping points of his spins. I realize that 2 showed more size and speed variation of large and small circles, but I left him third as he scored lower mainly because he received two half-point penalties for over spinning in both sets of spins.</section><br>
              <section>Nonetheless, it was 2’s advantage in functional correctness that placed him over 1 in my final pair. The dun was simply more correct in completing the prescribed pattern. Finding no obvious grants of 1 over 2 and as the dun received a score of zero for backing greater than 2 strides between the spins, I left him last. </section><br>
              <section>Thank You.</section>

            <p>The primary selection criteria for evaluating a trail class are: Obstacles Scores, Mannerisms, and Movement. Horses are to perform through a course of obstacles. This class will be judged on the performance of the horse over the obstacles with emphasis on manners, response to the rider, and quality of movement. The performance over each obstacle is scored positively or negatively. In addition, penalties are accessed for incomplete or incorrect performance through obstacles. Credit will be given to those horses negotiating the obstacles with style and some degree of speed, providing correctness is not sacrificed. Horses should receive credit for showing attentiveness to the obstacles and capability of picking their own way through the course when obstacles warrant it, and willingly responding to rider’s cues on more difficult obstacles. Scoring systems are outlined in rulebooks.</p>

              <section>Sir, I placed the Trail class 1-2-3-4, starting with the most responsive and willing horse in 1, and ending with a pair of poorer mannered, less broke horses in 3 and 4.</section><br>
              <section>Although, 1 could be cleaner over the logs, still in the top pair I placed 1 over 2, as the bay performs the pattern in a more willing manner. 1 responds more quickly while backing through the “L” and while sidepassing. Furthermore, 1 is quicker in picking up a more cadenced, controlled lope and is more alert and precise while crossing the bridge.</section><br>
              <section>I realize 2 is cleaner over the logs at the jog, but 2 incurs a penalty for stepping off the bridge, and moves with too much hesitation through the obstacles to be placed higher.</section><br>
              <section>However, I placed 2 over 3 in the middle pair, as the sorrel is simply more penalty free over the trot over and lope over logs. 3 incurs several one point penalties for hitting logs on the lope-over, and a 3 point penalty for breaking to a walk on the trot overs.</section><br>
              <section>Admittedly, 3 crossed the bridge more precisely, and is less hesitant in entering the L and moving over the logs, but as he received several penalties for hits and ticks on several of the obstacles, I left him third.</section><br>
              <section>3 does place over 4, the brown, in the final pair as 3 completed all the prescribed obstacles. 3 maintained an appropriate position with the gate, allowing for the rider to maintain control of the gate until the obstacle was completed. </section><br>
              <section>I realize that 4 was more willing in the ‘back through.’ Regardless, as the brown refused to work the gate three times, he must remain last.</section>

          <section>
            <p>Many contests will include showmanship, horsemanship, and equitation classes. These classes are designed to evaluate the exhibitor’s ability to execute, in concert with their horse, a set of maneuvers prescribed by the judge with precision and smoothness while exhibiting poise and confidence, and maintaining a balanced, functional, and fundamentally correct body position. Exhibitors are required to perform a prescribed pattern. Patterns are scored, one-half based on the overall appearance of the rider/showman and horse, and one-half on the performance of the pattern. The ideal pattern is extremely precise with the exhibitor and horse working in complete unison, executing each maneuver with subtle aids and cues. Details on scoring systems are provided in rulebooks.</p>
