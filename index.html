        <p>Judging programs are an instrumental part of the educational process of youth involved in the horse industry. Youth, parents, and volunteer leaders are interested in judging programs for many reasons. The reasons youth are interested and the reasons that adults are interested in involving their youth may differ in priority. The key to success is being able to develop a program that meets the motivational needs of both groups.</p>

        <p>Most youth enjoy going new places, socializing with friends and peers, having their opinions accepted, and receiving awards. Those with horse interests naturally enjoy learning skills that better their horsemanship ability and technical expertise about horses. As expertise and experience are gained, the desire to compete can increase. While many youth like to compete, contests are but one format for youth to learn. Activities such as field trips to horse farms, and horse shows and games that develop technical skills provide different formats for learning and are popular with youth. These activities should be low-stress, informal, short duration, and non-competitive.</p>
        <p>Successful leaders and coaches personalize their teaching methods, and as such, will have certain techniques they emphasize to teach youth.</p>
        <p>Regardless, all coaches should incorporate the following teaching philosophies:</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p class="col-md-6"><strong>Give the youth a clear goal by identifying the ideal animal or performance. </strong><br> Make comparisons emphasizing the positive attributes of the individual as compared with the ideal. <br>By doing so, the class requirements and optimum will be established.</p>
        <p class="col-md-6"><strong>Let youth learn by doing. </strong><br>Allow youth to try, provide assistance when youth ask for help, and then let them try again. <br>Give them the opportunity to find the answers by experience rather than simply trying to memorize what is told to them.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p class="col-md-6"><strong>Build on the youth’s expertise in a step-wise fashion as they become more accomplished. </strong><br>Develop organized systems that start by breaking down class requirements into a small number of major areas of assessment. <br>Increase youths’ depth of knowledge about the categories as they become more experienced and familiar with the class activity.</p>
        <p class="col-md-6"><strong>Promote discussion. </strong><br>Informal discussion helps youth integrate information while promoting the confidence to develop oral reasons. <br>Also, youth will learn from each other when discussing and reviewing, and youth enjoy having positive feedback when they express their opinions.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Stay current with judging standards.</dt>
        <dd>The need to supply clear, objective information as to what is required has made rulebooks and judge’s schools invaluable aids to judges and exhibitors alike.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Categorize the class requirements into several main areas of judgment, i.e. balance, muscle, structural correctness, and quality when judging conformation.</dt>
        <dd>By doing so, decisions will be based on correct judging standards and judgment will consider all the points of emphasis.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Identifying the ideal will help you organize the different criteria identified for placement and “measure” individuals based on their representation of the ideal.</dt>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Judging positively.</dt>
        <dd>Comparing the ‘good’ of each individual’s performance to the ideal will help to prioritize and weigh the importance of differences.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Learn, through proper practice, how to quickly assess the horse’s conformation of performance.</dt>
        <dd>By doing so, you can pay attention to all participants and all parts of the performance. This will allow for informed decisions on the overall merit of exhibition. This ability will also help to efficiently evaluate all individuals in the class, and guard against ‘missing’ part of the class or part of an exhibitor’s performance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>When viewing classes, position yourself so that you are evaluating the exhibitors from the same viewpoint (angle and distance).</dt>
        <dd>This technique will increase objectivity. When judging halter classes, your most objective comparisons are made when standing at least 20 to 30 feet from the horses. On rail classes, allow the exhibitors to give you the same view when measuring quality of movement, mannerisms, and functional correctness. Many judges will stand near the center of the arena one third of the way off one of the side rails and view the farther side rail when judging group rail classes. When judging individual pattern classes, position yourself in the area that gives you the best view of the entire performance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Keep your attention on the class while it is in session.</dt>
        <dd>Distractions that divert your attention away from the class will cause you to miss part of the performance. Develop methods to lessen the need for notes, and do not make notes until the performance is over, or at some time when evaluation needs are small, i.e. during a change of direction or as horses line up at the end of rail classes.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Maintain a level of confidence that requires you to do your own work.</dt>
        <dd>Do not let other judges, exhibitors, or spectators influence your decision.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>The judge’s card is the final record of placement.</dt>
        <dd>It is difficult at best, or more times impossible, to correct number or placement errors once the card has been completed. Emphasize to youth the importance of correctly marking their final placing cards. Errors such as omitting an exhibitor or misnumbering can easily occur. However, they are inexcusable.</dd>
