        <p>Judging programs are an instrumental part of the educational process of youth involved in the horse industry. Youth, parents, and volunteer leaders are interested in judging programs for many reasons. The reasons youth are interested and the reasons that adults are interested in involving their youth may differ in priority. The key to success is being able to develop a program that meets the motivational needs of both groups.</p>

        <p>Most youth enjoy going new places, socializing with friends and peers, having their opinions accepted, and receiving awards. Those with horse interests naturally enjoy learning skills that better their horsemanship ability and technical expertise about horses. As expertise and experience are gained, the desire to compete can increase. While many youth like to compete, contests are but one format for youth to learn. Activities such as field trips to horse farms, and horse shows and games that develop technical skills provide different formats for learning and are popular with youth. These activities should be low-stress, informal, short duration, and non-competitive.</p>
        <p>Successful leaders and coaches personalize their teaching methods, and as such, will have certain techniques they emphasize to teach youth.</p>
        <p>Regardless, all coaches should incorporate the following teaching philosophies:</p>

        <dt>Stay current with judging standards.</dt>
        <dd>The need to supply clear, objective information as to what is required has made rulebooks and judge’s schools invaluable aids to judges and exhibitors alike.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Categorize the class requirements into several main areas of judgment, i.e. balance, muscle, structural correctness, and quality when judging conformation.</dt>
        <dd>By doing so, decisions will be based on correct judging standards and judgment will consider all the points of emphasis.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Identifying the ideal will help you organize the different criteria identified for placement and “measure” individuals based on their representation of the ideal.</dt>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Judging positively.</dt>
        <dd>Comparing the ‘good’ of each individual’s performance to the ideal will help to prioritize and weigh the importance of differences.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Learn, through proper practice, how to quickly assess the horse’s conformation of performance.</dt>
        <dd>By doing so, you can pay attention to all participants and all parts of the performance. This will allow for informed decisions on the overall merit of exhibition. This ability will also help to efficiently evaluate all individuals in the class, and guard against ‘missing’ part of the class or part of an exhibitor’s performance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>When viewing classes, position yourself so that you are evaluating the exhibitors from the same viewpoint (angle and distance).</dt>
        <dd>This technique will increase objectivity. When judging halter classes, your most objective comparisons are made when standing at least 20 to 30 feet from the horses. On rail classes, allow the exhibitors to give you the same view when measuring quality of movement, mannerisms, and functional correctness. Many judges will stand near the center of the arena one third of the way off one of the side rails and view the farther side rail when judging group rail classes. When judging individual pattern classes, position yourself in the area that gives you the best view of the entire performance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Keep your attention on the class while it is in session.</dt>
        <dd>Distractions that divert your attention away from the class will cause you to miss part of the performance. Develop methods to lessen the need for notes, and do not make notes until the performance is over, or at some time when evaluation needs are small, i.e. during a change of direction or as horses line up at the end of rail classes.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>Maintain a level of confidence that requires you to do your own work.</dt>
        <dd>Do not let other judges, exhibitors, or spectators influence your decision.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="col-lg-8">
        <dt>The judge’s card is the final record of placement.</dt>
        <dd>It is difficult at best, or more times impossible, to correct number or placement errors once the card has been completed. Emphasize to youth the importance of correctly marking their final placing cards. Errors such as omitting an exhibitor or misnumbering can easily occur. However, they are inexcusable.</dd>

      <section class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Judging contests provide individuals with the opportunity to judge halter and performance classes consisting of at least four horses in a class. The number and type of classes will vary between contests. The current standard is to provide four to six halter classes and four to eight performance classes. Some guidelines for organizing contests include:</p>

        <!-- <div class="glyphicon glyphicon-home" aria-hidden="true"></div> -->
        <p>Facilities. An arena is needed with adequate size for both halter and performance classes (at least 100’ X 200’ is recommended). A room large enough for the tabulation crew in close proximity to the oral reasons area will also be needed. Additionally, facilities may be needed for a coach’s meeting and awards program. </p>

      <section class="col-lg-4">
        <!-- <div class="knight"></div> -->
        <p>Horses. The most difficult challenge to contest organizers is organizing placeable classes of quality horses to judge. After it has been decided which classes (and breeds) will be included, the contacts must be made to ensure at least four horses for each class will be available. Contest classes should have enough variability to be readily placeable.</p>
      </section>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <section class="col-lg-4">
        <p>People. Individuals are needed to serve as group leaders, timekeeper, announcer, card runner(s), class organizers inside and outside the arena and tabulators. Official judges that are knowledgeable in the breeds to be judged, and have experience as a member or coach of a judging team should be selected as early as possible. Equal consideration should be given to the selection of qualified reasons takers. </p>
      </section>
      <section class="col-lg-4">
        <p>Awards. It is customary to give awards to the top teams and individuals in placing, reasons, and overall categories. The type of awards depends on the interests of the program organizers, and should not be totally dictated by sponsors.</p>

      <section class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Contests begin by having youth place a series of judging classes. The judging classes are divided into halter and performance. All the performance or all the halter classes may be conducted first. After the classes are judged, youth are given a small amount of time, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, to prepare oral reasons.</p>

      <section class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Performance classes are judged from the stands. An official calls the gaits and conducts the class via the announcer. Halter classes are judged in groups in the arena. it is customary for more than one class of horses to be shown at halter in the arena at the same time to allow smaller groups for better viewing of halter classes. Contestants are positioned to the side of the horses, approximately 20 to 30 feet from the class, and the horses are repositioned so contestants can see different views.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <section class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Oral reasons are given on several of the classes. The number of oral reasons depends on the contest. Usually at least two to as many as six different classes are identified as ‘reasons classes’. Contestants are informed if a class is being considered for oral reasons before the judging of that class. If there are more potential performance reason classes than the number of reasons that will be given, it is customary for the youth to take notes on all of them before the final selection of reason classes is made.</p>
        <p>Youth are divided into smaller groups to prepare and give oral reasons. Each of the smaller groups will start with a different set of reasons, and then rotate to a new set until all have been given. By doing so, all the reasons can be given during the same time period by rotating the groups around the reason takers. A reasons order rotation system must be developed and remain in effect so all youth are given the same amount of time to prepare each set of oral reasons.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Compare the contestant’s first place horse to each of the other horses in the class. A penalty (cut) will be assessed whenever the contestant’s ranking of the first place horse differs with its official ranking.</li>

As such, there are no deductions.</li>
                  <li>Next, compare the contestant’s first place, 2, and the contestant’s third place, 1, with the official. The official places 1 over 2, so there is a deduction. The deduction is 3 points, as this is the total number of cuts between the 1 and 2 in the official ranking.</li>

        <p>In the competitive judging environment, major emphasis is placed on learning to evaluate horses. However, successful judging programs place equal importance on students learning to organize and defend their reasons of placing the class. The combined process of placing horses and orally defending those placings teaches students to be objective, honest, and fair in their approach to evaluating the class. Also, this process will discourage student judges from giving opinions that are based merely on personal likes and dislikes, and encourage them to present defensible judgments based on current standards of the horse industry.</p>
        <p>Another major purpose for giving reasons in judging contests is to offer an opportunity for students to learn how to think, organize thoughts, and speak confidently about those thoughts in a refereed environment.</p>
        <p>Giving reasons helps individuals to judge in a more organized fashion. Giving an organized set of reasons will help the inexperienced analyze horses point by point and think in comparative terms.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>In a judging contest, students are often present their oral reasons several hours after they actually judge the class. Notes enable youth to prepare a more accurate and detailed set of reasons. These notes are only a preparation aid and should not be used during the actual reasons presentation. Brief, understandable notes that are relevant to the class criteria serve as a memory aid. Most judges will use less notes as they become more experienced and more developed in their memory skills.</p>
        <p>Note taking should not interfere with the observation of the class. Notes should be taken after you have studied the class and observed the differences between the individuals. Individual pattern classes require scores and brief notes be taken following each horse. With practice, each person will develop their own method of taking notes. Some use symbols and shorthand methods to save time. </p>
        <p>Notes should contain the class name and the class placing at the top of the note page. Individual descriptions of horses serve as memory aids. Notes should be organized to support the format of oral delivery. As such, notes should be organized so pairs of horses are compared. Several different note-taking grids have been developed to help organization of notes (Figure 1).</p>

        <p>There are several acceptable variations of organizational formats for oral reasons. The basis for organization is comparisons of pairs of horses. In a four-horse class there is a top pair (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> place), a middle pair (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> place), and a bottom pair (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> place). Each pair is discussed in terms of comparable advantages of the top placing horse to the bottom placing horse in the pair. From that basis, additional items are added to help assist the clarity, depth, and interest of the presentation.</p>

This framework is built upon to develop formats that promote the individual’s strengths and the coach’s preference. Use of transition statements and additional criticism statements increase the level of difficulty of presentation (Figure 2).</p>

              <b>Miniature Opening Statement:</b> Should be a general reason why 1 is placed over 2; again, it needs to specifically fit this pair of horses. Select terminology from the primary selection criteria for that class (Halter: Balance, Quality, Structure, Muscling, and Travel). This should be one sentence by itself.
              <ul>
                <li>Example: “One is not only higher quality, but also nicer balanced.”</li>
              </ul>
              <b>Qualify Your Placing of 1 over 2:</b> Use specific, comparative terminology (“-er” on the end of word) to substantiate higher quality and nicer balanced. Qualifying terminology should be given in order of relevancy. If the point did not influence the placing, don’t talk about it.
              <br><br>
              <b>Grant 2 over 1:</b> Again, in comparative terms, specify where and how 2 is better than 1. In a very close pair, there may be as many grant terms as initial reasons for 1 over 2. In very obvious placing you may have only one or even no grant terms that are applicable.
              <ul>
                <li>Example: “I admit the sorrel with two hind socks is ...” or “finding no major advantages for 2 over 1.”</li>
              </ul>
              <b>Criticize 2:</b> A specific description (not comparative) of the individual. “However, as 2 is thick necked and short hipped, I placed the sorrel second.”
              <br><br>
              <b>Transition into Intermediate Pair:</b> Use words like “even so” and “still yet” to make a smooth transition into the next pair.

                <li>Example: “Even so, in my intermediate pair, I placed 2 over 3.”</li>

              Your reasons should accurately describe the class so that the listener can form a visual image of the horses as you speak. Your goal is to paint a visual image of the class that agrees with what the reasons taker saw. Therefore, always state the most important points first so the official can follow your selection process. If you present the horses in an unorganized fashion or talk about irrelevant points, the reason taker will become confused or disinterested and the result will be a lower score.

              Higher reason scores are given to those with impact. In other words, those who can say the most with the least amount of words are given credit. Don’t add words and phrases that are redundant or have no impact on the placing of the class. For example, instead of saying “number 2, the bay horse”, say “the bay” or “2”. Reasons must be given within a two-minute time limit and most contests will assess penalty points for going overtime. The average time for a set of reasons should be around 1 minute and 30-40 seconds or even shorter for younger, less experienced judges.

              Reasons should be organized and systematic. The basic approach is the comparison of animals in three pairs: the top pair, the middle pair, and the bottom pair. The focus should be placed on why one animal is placed over another animal within each pair, and should be given in a comparative fashion.

              Reasons should reflect the actual differences in the pair and should consist primarily of those points of comparison that were significant in the placing of the pair. In other words, stay on the important issues within the pair. Talking about insignificant or irrelevant points is discouraged.

              When comparing one horse to another, terminology should always be comparative. Descriptive terminology may be used to a limited extent in the opening statements and to describe faults of an individual. Comparative terminology lists are included in following sections. By using comparative terminology, the student is relating the horse to the horse placed above or below. It will also aid in keeping main points in mind. The top horse in the pair may be well balanced, heavily muscled, and structurally correct, but it is of little concern unless the top horse is more nicely balanced, heavier muscled, and more structurally correct than the bottom horse of the pair.

              Oral reasons should be presented in a poised, confident, and convincing manner, but they should never convey arrogance. Loud, boisterous delivery, as well as shy, timid unconvincing presentations are discouraged.

              Rather, reasons should be presented in a confident, yet relaxed, pleasing and conversational manner. The use of correct English is also a must. While good presentation is important, it must be combined with accuracy, organization, relevancy, and proper terminology for a good score. Reasons should be given in two minutes or less.
